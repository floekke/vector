## How It Works

The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies.daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host. Typically data is collected from a process
manager, such as Journald via Vector's [`journald`
source][docs.sources.journald], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"file"}
  sinkName={"aws_kinesis_firehose"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

## How It Works

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies.service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations. Typically, upstream sources are other
Vector instances sending data via the [`vector` sink][docs.sinks.vector], but
can be collected through any of Vector's [sources][docs.sources]. The following
diagram demonstrates how it works.

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"http"}
  sinkName={"kafka"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

## How It Works

The [sidecar deployment strategy][docs.strategies.sidecar] is designed to
collect data from a _single_ service. Vector has a tight 1 to 1 coupling with
the service. Typically data is collected by tailing local files via Vector's
[`file` source][docs.sources.file], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"stdin"}
  sinkName={"aws_cloudwatch_logs"} />

</li>

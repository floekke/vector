So you want to send logs from Journald to another Vector instance? Sounds simple! Sadly, it is not.
When you account for x, y, and z, you quickly realize this is no easy endaevor.
Especially for high volume product environments! Fear not! This guide will get
you up and running in minutes.

## What We'll Accomplish

<ol className="list--checks list--lg list--semi-bold list--primary list--flush">
  <li>
    Collect Journald/Systemd logs.
    <ol>
      <li>Filter which Systemd units you collect them from.</li>
      <li>Checkpoint your position to ensure data is not lost between restarts.</li>
      <li>Enrich your logs with useful Systemd context.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send data to another downstream Vector instance.

</ol>

## How It Works

The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies.daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host. Typically data is collected from a process
manager, such as Journald via Vector's [`journald`
source][docs.sources.journald], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"journald"}
  sinkName={"vector"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

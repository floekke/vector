## What We'll Accomplish

<ol className="list--checks list--lg list--semi-bold list--primary list--flush">
  <li>
    Accept log data just like the Splunk HTTP event collector.
    <ol>
      <li>Automatically parse incoming data into structured events.</li>
      <li>Optionally require authentication on all requests.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to AWS Kinesis Firehose.
    <ol>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li className="list--li--arrow list--li--pink">All in just a few minutes. Let's get started!</li>
</ol>

## How It Works

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies.service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations. Typically, upstream sources are other
Vector instances sending data via the [`vector` sink][docs.sinks.vector], but
can be collected through any of Vector's [sources][docs.sources]. The following
diagram demonstrates how it works.

## Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path="vector.toml"
  sourceName={"splunk_hec"}
  sinkName={"aws_kinesis_firehose"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

## How We'll Do It

<SVG src="/img/deployment-strategies-docker-daemon.svg" />

As shown in the diagram above, we'll be deploying [Vector][urls.vector_website]
as a [daemon][docs.strategies.daemon] to collect all of your Docker logs on a
single host. We'll deploy Vector in it's own container, just like your other
services, so that your workflow doesn't deviate.

## A Simple Step-By-Step Tutorial

<div className="steps steps--h3">

1. ### Configure Vector

   <ConfigExample
    format="toml"
    path="vector.toml"
    sourceName={"docker"}
    sinkName={"sematext_logs"} />

2. ### Start the Vector container

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -v $PWD/vector.toml:/etc/vector/vector.toml:ro \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     timberio/vector:latest-alpine
   ```

   <CodeExplanation>

   * The `-v $PWD/vector.to...` flag passes your custom configuration to Vector.
   * The `-v /var/run/docke...` flag ensures that Vector has access to the Docker API.
   * The `timberio/vector:latest-alpine` is the default image we've chosen, you are welcome to use [other image variants][docs.platforms.docker#variants].

   </CodeExplanation>

   That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

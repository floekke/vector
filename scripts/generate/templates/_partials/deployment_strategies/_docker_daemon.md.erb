The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies.daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own
container, collecting _all_ data for that host. Typically, data is collected
directly from the Docker API via Vector's [`docker` source][docs.sources.docker],
but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

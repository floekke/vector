The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies.service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is desigend to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations. Typically, upstream sources are other
Vector instances sending data via the [`vector` sink][docs.sinks.vector], but
can be collected through any of Vector's [sources][docs.sources]. The following
diagram demonstrates how it works.

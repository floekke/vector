The [daemon deployment strategy][docs.strategies.daemon] is designed for data
collection on a single host. Vector runs in the background, in its own process,
collecting _all_ data for that host. Typically data is collected from a process
manager, such as Journald via Vector's [`journald`
source][docs.sources.journald], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.
